A Plot for life.

Current version: v2.2.5 (see version history below).

Added an option to turn on the plot boundary markers from the plot pole.  Markers remain until reboot after which they can be turned on again.

v1.0
Kudos to WGC GeekGarage for the original concept in his release here and all the work tracking down where the changes needed to be made.  That must have been a lot of hard work and I in no way envy the task.
