Pre check
 
What it does.
 
This SQL will check all the playerUIDs you have and show any that will be affected with the limitation 1. issue highlighted below.  This pre-check will not change anything.
 
PC.1 - Open your prefered SQL tool (SQL Workbench / Heidi SQL or the like).
 
PC.2 - Open an sql editor window and connect to your MySQL server.
 
PC.3 - Put in the function that handles the conversion.  Paste the following and run it.

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS text2digits; 
DELIMITER | 
CREATE FUNCTION text2digits( str CHAR(32) ) RETURNS CHAR(32) 
BEGIN 
  DECLARE i, len SMALLINT DEFAULT 1; 
  DECLARE ret CHAR(32) DEFAULT ''; 
  DECLARE c CHAR(1); 
  SET len = CHAR_LENGTH( str ); 
  REPEAT 
    BEGIN 
      SET c = MID( str, i, 1 ); 
      IF c BETWEEN '0' AND '9' THEN  
        SET ret=CONCAT(ret,c); 
 else
SET ret=CONCAT(ret,"9");
      END IF; 
      SET i = i + 1; 
    END; 
  UNTIL i > len END REPEAT; 
  RETURN ret; 
END | 
DELIMITER ; 

PC.4 - Open a second sql session and paste in the following code and run it.

select * from character_data
where text2digits(playerUID) > 2147483647; 

PC.5a - If you see any rows displayed then you are likely to have an issue. In your second SQL session paste the following to clear the conversion function and it is advised you do not install this mod.

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS text2digits; 

PC.5b - If you see no rows returned then you are unlikely to be affected at the moment with limitation 1. listed above.  Continue with the steps below to install.
