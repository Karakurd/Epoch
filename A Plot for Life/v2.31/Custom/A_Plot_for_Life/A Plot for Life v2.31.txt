Merge files for Snap Build Pro and the modular player build framework.

Snap Build Pro has been merged with the player build framework by Raymix for Epoch 1.0.5.2.  DOwnload both and extract them.  Copy the files to a directory of your choice but exclude the following files which I have supplied already merged and linked in the compiles.sqf;
 - player_build.sqf
 - player_build_create.sqf
 - player_build_plotCheck.sqf
 - player_build_publish.sqf
 - snap_build.sqf
 - modular_build.sqf

Link the other files from Snap Build Pro and the modular player build framework in the compiles.sqf as needed (the lines should already be there, just search for DZE_modularBuild).
